Representations and algorithms for abstract data types, mainly for :
	- lists
	- maps
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SDA_lab1_2 -> matrix as a dynamic array of triplets (row, column, value)

SDA_lab2_2 -> matrix as doubly-linked list

SDA_lab4_6 -> ordered set as linked list with links represented on array (+ iterator)

lab6_pb24 -> multi-ordered map as dynamic hashtable (+ iterator)

SDA_lab7_pb2 -> matrix as dynamic binary search tree
